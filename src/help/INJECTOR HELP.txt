This is the help for the Injector.

The injector runs codes from a local basis basically meaning not all codes are server sided.
So certain codes may have to be created for certain things.

For example

base.localAvatar.enterRun()

This is not server sided ^
But. If you use a pyDatagram or a built in server sided function to send the command.
It'll be server sided.

That's all for now.
